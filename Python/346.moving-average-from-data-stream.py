#
# Given a stream of integers and a window size, calculate the moving average of
# all integers in the sliding window.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# MovingAverage m = new MovingAverage(3);
# m.next(1) = 1
# m.next(10) = (1 + 10) / 2
# m.next(3) = (1 + 10 + 3) / 3
# m.next(5) = (10 + 3 + 5) / 3
#

# Your MovingAverage object will be instantiated and called as such:
