#
# Given the root of a binary tree, turn the tree upside down and return the new
# root.
# 
# You can turn a binary tree upside down with the following steps:
# 
# 
# The original left child becomes the new root.
# The original root becomes the new right child.
# The original right childÂ becomes the new left child.
# 
# 
# 
# 
# The mentioned steps are done level by level, it is guaranteed that every node
# in the given tree has either 0 or 2 children.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
# Output: [4,5,2,null,null,3,1]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = []
# Output: []
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1]
# Output: [1]
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range [0, 10].
# 1 <= Node.val <= 10
# Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
# 
# 
#

#         self.val = val
