# [75] Sort Colors

class Solution:
    # This is a dutch partitioning problem. We are classifying the array into four groups: 
    # red, white, unclassified, and blue. Initially we group all elements into unclassified. 
    # We iterate from the beginning as long as the white pointer is less than the blue pointer.

    # If the white pointer is red (nums[white] == 0), we swap with the red pointer and move both
    # white and red pointer forward. If the pointer is white (nums[white] == 1), the element is 
    # already in correct place, so we donâ€™t have to swap, just move the white pointer forward. 
    # If the white pointer is blue, we swap with the latest unclassified element.
